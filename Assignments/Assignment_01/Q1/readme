Write a simple program in C++ to display the output below exactly as shown 
(i.e., it should inlcude white space to position the pyramid toward the right, as shown). 
>./a.out
                   *             
                  ^^^
                 *****
                ^^^^^^^
               *********
              ^^^^^^^^^^^
Important: You are not allowed to use a "string" (or a character string literal) data type in your code. 
So DO NOT take an apporach similar to the following:

cout << "*" << endl;
cout << "       ^^^" << endl;
cout << "      *****" << endl;

Instead, use a for loop or a while loop to print various characters. 
Observe that the first line contains 1 char, the second line contains 3 chars, the third line contains 5 chars, etc. 
Also, the characters alternate from one line to another. 
Use these observations to your advantage in framing your logic inside your for/while loop.
